# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Prabodh KC**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Game Of throne API** is an android app that **fill in description (Example: "An app that displays a random character from the Game of Thrones API")**
I also made some changes after my fiest submission did not meet the criteria.
If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ«¥ðŸ« ðŸ¤§**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **Game of throne characters**.
